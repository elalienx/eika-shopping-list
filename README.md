## Project organization

The component organization and CSS styles is done using the Atomic design methodology by Brad Frost. ([link](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)) This methodology is mentioned in the official React guide under File Structure. ([link](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-file-type))
